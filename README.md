## Hey there!

Welcome to my solution for the task given by MobileLife

To start the project you basically run:
```
npm i
npm start
```

And then head to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it.

The website in its entirety was designed and developed by Andrew Chepreghy based on this task:

"Attached is some property data in json format.

Display a list of properties from the property data. Style the items in the list in an interesting way, feel free to add animations.

Please use https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app as the starting point.

Send us a link with the source code for your solution on github and if possible a place to see it. Please don't use too much time on the exercise, it is more to get a basic idea of your coding skills and ways of thinking."

Yeah... I clearly forgot the "Don't use too much time on the exercise" thing. :D Anyways, I hope you like it ;)
