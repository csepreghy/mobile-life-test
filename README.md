npm start
```

And then head to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it.

The website in its entirety was designed and developed by Andrew Chepreghy based on this task:

"Attached is some property data in json format.

Display a list of properties from the property data. Style the items in the list in an interesting way, feel free to add animations.

Please use https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app as the starting point.
